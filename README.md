This project was the submission for the BITS-Goa Hack,2020. 

The idea being the project is an end to end solution for waste segragation, collection and disposal.

The project aims to improve waste segragation and collection using smart bins fueled by machine learning, the code for which is Waste Master.
The bin notifies the backend on being filled, which is hosted using Django
The garbage collector is notified via a flutter app and a route optimization algorithm directs him to the various filled bins, after which the garbage is disposed.


## ROLE IN THE TEAM :
Backend development, integration of route optimization algorithm.
